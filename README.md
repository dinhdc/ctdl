## Here are five Big O run times that you’ll encounter a lot, sorted from fastest to slowest

- O(log n), also known as log time. Example: `Binary search`.
- O(n), also known as linear time. Example: `Simple search.`
- O(n \* log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like `quicksort`.
- O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like `selection sort`.
- O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.
